# Investment Tech Tree

An interactive visualization platform for exploring fusion energy technology development pathways and investment opportunities. This web application provides a comprehensive view of nuclear reactor concepts (both fusion and fission), enabling technologies, and key milestones in the nuclear energy landscape.

## Project Purpose

The Investment Tech Tree serves as a decision-support tool for investors, researchers, and policymakers in the nuclear energy sector. It visualizes the complex relationships between different technologies, their current Technology Readiness Levels (TRL), and the critical milestones needed to advance toward commercial nuclear power.

The platform features a full CRUD interface for editing the technology tree, AI-powered document analysis for suggesting improvements, and integration with MongoDB for persistent data storage.

## Architecture Overview

### Data Structure

The application uses MongoDB Atlas for persistent data storage with three main node types:

1. **Reactor Concepts**: Core fusion reactor designs (Tokamak, Stellarator, FRC, ICF)
2. **Milestones**: Critical achievements and demonstrations
3. **Enabling Technologies**: Supporting technologies and components

Each node includes:

- Technology Readiness Level (TRL) tracking
- Detailed descriptions and context
- Category and subtype classification
- Projected development timelines
- References and citations
- InFact analysis results (when available)
