        "description": "Silicon‑carbide‑based ceramic matrix composites (CMC), such as SiC/SiC, offer higher temperature capability, lower density, and improved oxidation resistance than metallic superalloys, enabling operation of certain hot‑section components at metal temperatures beyond 1200–1300 °C with reduced or no active cooling. CMCs have reached commercial use in aero‑engine shrouds and some vanes and are being developed for industrial gas turbine blades and other hot‑gas‑path parts, with promising tests of CMC vanes and blades in rigs and demonstrator engines. However, large‑scale deployment of CMC rotating blades in heavy‑duty power turbines is still at the demonstration and qualification stage, with challenges including cost, manufacturability, impact resistance, and attachment design.",

        "description": "Dual-fuel engines using ammonia as primary fuel with diesel/HFO pilot ignition for stationary power generation. Addresses carbon emissions but faces challenges with combustion stability and NOx/ammonia slip. 90% ammonia energy substitution demonstrated in research engines, reducing CO2 emissions by 93.7% but increasing NOx and ammonia slip. Requires high compression ratios (35:1) for ammonia-only operation.",

Demonstrated for automotive but scaling to stationary power generation still in development. Achieves 55% brake thermal efficiency in research with 30% fuel consumption reduction compared to conventional diesel. Favorable surface area/volume ratio reduces heat transfer, but durability challenges with wrist pins and thermal management being addressed.",
