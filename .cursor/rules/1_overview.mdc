# Investment Tech Tree

## Project Overview

This is a Next.js-based interactive visualization platform for fusion energy technology development pathways. The application uses React Flow for graph visualization, Google Gemini for AI chat, and TypeScript for type safety.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 15, React 19, TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS, Radix UI components
- **Visualization**: React Flow, ELK.js for graph layout
- **AI**: Google Gemini API for contextual chat
- **Development**: ESLint, Prettier, lint-staged

## Code Style & Quality

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow ESLint and Prettier configurations
- Write self-documenting code with clear variable names
- Add JSDoc comments for complex functions
- Use functional components with hooks
- Prefer composition over inheritance

## File Structure Conventions

- Components in `src/components/`
- Utility functions in `src/lib/`
- Types in `src/lib/types.ts`
- Data in `src/DATA.ts`
- UI components in `src/components/ui/`

## Data Model

The application uses three main node types:

1. **ReactorConcept**: Core fusion reactor designs
2. **Milestone**: Critical achievements and demonstrations  
3. **EnablingTechnology**: Supporting technologies

Each node includes TRL tracking, descriptions, and category classification.

## Development Guidelines

- Test changes locally before committing
- Update documentation when modifying data structures
- Follow React best practices for state management
- Use proper error handling for API calls
- Implement proper loading states for async operations

## AI Integration

- Rate limiting is implemented for Gemini API calls
- Chat history is persisted in localStorage
- XSS protection via DOMPurify for AI responses
- Context includes full tech tree data for informed responses

## Common Patterns

- Use React Flow for graph interactions
- Implement proper TypeScript interfaces
- Follow Next.js App Router conventions
- Use Tailwind utility classes for styling
- Implement responsive design patterns
